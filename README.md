# MI Tube

A chrome plugin that lets users alter YouTube's homepage recommendation to boost productivity. Cost-free. We produced because we needed it and wanted to share it.

YouTube's homepage suggestions can force us to waste a lot of time. Youtube's algorithm is meant to keep you addicted to short-time pleasure videos to boost your retention time, but this plugin lets you choose what to watch. This plugin removes feed suggestions and lets the user choose.
